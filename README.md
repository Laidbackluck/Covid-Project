# Covid-Project-Repository

The goal of this project is to extract insights and deliver a interactive visualization to showcase the analysis on historical data of COVID-19, up to the date Jan 8, 2022

We will accomplish this by using python to connect to a Postgre SQL database, performing some SQL queries to extract data,  save those quesries as views, and finally use those views in a data visulization tool, such as Tableau or PowerBI, to create an interative visualization. 

The data for this project was downloaded as a .csv file from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), modified and formatted in Microsoft Excel into two separate .csv files ("CovidDeaths.csv" and "CovidVaccinations.csv"), and then uploaded to a local Postgre SQL database.

The making of this notebook was inspired by [Alex The Analyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst) and his [Covid Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&t=567s)
